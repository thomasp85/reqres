# reqres: Powerful Classes for HTTP Requests and Responses

In order to facilitate parsing of http requests and creating appropriate
responses this package provides two classes to handle a lot of the
housekeeping involved in working with http exchanges. The infrastructure
builds upon the 'rook' specification and is thus well suited to be
combined with 'httpuv' based web servers.
