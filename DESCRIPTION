Description: In order to facilitate parsing of http requests and creating 
    appropriate responses this package provides two classes to handle a lot of
    the housekeeping involved in working with http exchanges. The infrastructure
    builds upon the 'rook' specification and is thus well suited to be combined
    with 'httpuv' based web servers.
