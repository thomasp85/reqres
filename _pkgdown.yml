reference:
  - title: "Request and response classes"
    desc: >
      The main raison d'être for reqres is to provide classes handling http
      requests and responses. As both are coded as R6 classes with reference
      semantics all functionality of the object are documented together with the
      class.

      - Request
      - Response
  - title: "Content parsing and formatting"
    desc: >
      A main part of working with http requests and responses is related to
      getting the content of a request and setting the content of a response.
      While the Request and Response classes handle content negotiation it is
      up to the developer to tell how data of a certain type should be parsed or
      formattet. reqres provides a range of parsers and formatters for common
      exchange formats in order to ease the pain of this part.
    contents:
      - parsers
      - default_parsers
      - formatters
      - default_formatters
  - title: "Utilities"
    desc: >
      reqres includes a small selection of utilities beyond the ones mentioned
      above, which are listed here.
